The documentation for your software is the users, and even your own,  main view into the inner workings of your code. Most people who are putting any effort into a piece of software will want that code to work for a long time, and we can't rely on not having to fix any bugs that pop up along the way, which means that it is beyon crucial to have documentation in place to help track all aspects of each application and how they fit together. You shouldn't expect that you will remember how each module of your code works together, and in the same breath, you shouldn't expect a user attempting to use or alter your code to be able to look at it and know what's going on without any sort of documentation as a guide.
