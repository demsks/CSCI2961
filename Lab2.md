## (2) Why is it important to choose a license?

A software license is a legal document which governs the use and/or redistibution of software. Choosing a license allows 
the creater(s) of a code base to dictate what can be done with said code. For example, during our lecture period, the lecturer 
mentioned a certain piece of software which was licensed in a way to make it illegal for governments or army's to use. With the 
license, the creator(s) are providing a legal barrier for governments to use the software. Whether or not they care about the 
license in this case.. 

## (3) Why shouldn't you work on software that doesn't have an explicit license?

The absence of a license means that default copyright laws apply. This means that the owner of the software retain all rights to
their source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. Thus, by working on it,
you may be breaking the law. You should always assume that the absence of a license means you do not have permission to use or alter
the software.

## (4) Reflection on "Why The Web Beat Gopher"

Do I agree? Absolutely! In a time where technology was so rapidly advancing, having the community which will be using the software as 
well as allowing developers to potentially tinker with the software is huge. On top of this, as the author stated, by structuring their 
license the way they did, they went against a community which ultimately wanted to help advance their software. Both of these actions
combined had a snowball effect which may have ultimately led to the fall of Gopher. 

## (5) Justification for Linux using the GPLv2 license

Linux chose to switch to a GPL license, a copyleft license, to allow integration with GNU components. The license which they had started with barred distributing the code for money, a term which made total integration with GNU not possible. As to why they are still using GPLv2 over GPLv3, well I think the answer may be two fold. One reason is that they would need everyone who ever contributed to the codebase to sign off on the switch and, if they declined, the code from the contributor(s) would have to be removed or redone. Secondly, Linus expressed dislike with GPLv3 for several reasons and stated that v3 was not a good succesor to v2. 

## (6) Example Project. Pick a license as a group using license chooser on github. 

A project I am interested in starting is a better note taking application for my Surface Pro machine. The applications available for the device currently is less than stellar. The license I choose is the MIT license as I want anyone to be able to do anything they want with it. 

## (7) Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better, for a developer, for a company and for the common good

The Apache/BSD license makes it so users do not have to distribute the modified version of code, nor do you have to worry about it infecting a derived work, that is so long as you include their license. For this, Apache may be better fitted for companies.  The GPL license essentially makes any code with ties to GPL code a derivitive of the code being linked and requires it also be released with the gpl license. The important part is that you can charge money for money for GPL licensed code. If you create a combined work using seperate parts of code which have differing licences, you may be blocked from distirubting the code, however, if you don't plan on distributing the code, then you are free to do, and combine, what you wish. Thus, this may deter business from altering a code base for profit as they will have to make their source code public. For this reason, it may be better for the developer and the common good (what's the difference). Software using the LGPL do not have to relist their modified software under the LGPL license, nor do they need to be released - a major difference from GPL. LGPL benefits developers, but isn't that benefiting the common good in the end :). 
Note: GPL is the most popular software license. The BSD is a very permissive license in that it essentially allows you to do anything with the code base. 


## (8) Create a repository and choose a license

I chose to create this classes repository, located  [here](https://github.com/demsks/CSCI2961).

I choose to give the class repository an MIT license to allow the teacher, or whomever, to reference the work. 


## (9) I plan on altering something on Hack-rpi or Rcos. The users will be students, staculty, and staff here on campus. I was specifically interested in the BettereteBinder project as it will give students a means to store and share notes, handouts, and past exams. The license currently used by the software is MIT, so if I did decide to work on it, I would choose to keep the MIT license. 

## (10) Choose 5 projects from links provided and create a table giving the website, whether a license is present, and the type of license. 

Website | License Present | License
---------|:----------|:-------
