## (2) Why is it important to choose a license?

A software license is a legal document which governs the use and/or redistibution of software. Choosing a license allows 
the creater(s) of a code base to dictate what can be done with said code. For example, during our lecture period, the lecturer 
mentioned a certain piece of software which was licensed in a way to make it illegal for governments or army's to use. With the 
license, the creator(s) are providing a legal barrier for governments to use the software. Whether or not they care about the 
license in this case.. 

## (3) Why shouldn't you work on software that doesn't have an explicit license?

The absence of a license means that default copyright laws apply. This means that the owner of the software retain all rights to
their source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. Thus, by working on it,
you may be breaking the law. You should always assume that the absence of a license means you do not have permission to use or alter
the software.

## (4) Reflection on "Why The Web Beat Gopher"

Do I agree? Absolutely! In a time where technology was so rapidly advancing, having the community which will be using the software as 
well as allowing developers to potentially tinker with the software is huge. On top of this, as the author stated, by structuring their 
license the way they did, they went against a community which ultimately wanted to help advance their software. Both of these actions
combined had a snowball effect which may have ultimately led to the fall of Gopher. 

## (5) Justification for Linux using the GPLv2 license

Linux chose to switch to a GPL license, a copyleft license, to allow integration with GNU components. The license which they had started 
with barred distributing the code for money, a term which made total integration with GNU not possible. As to why they are still 
using GPLv2 over GPLv3, well I think the answer may be two fold. One reason is that they would need everyone who ever contributed to
the codebase to sign off on the switch and, if they declined, the code from the contributor(s) would have to be removed or redone.
Secondly, Linus expressed dislike with GPLv3 for several reasons and stated that v3 was not a good succesor to v2.
