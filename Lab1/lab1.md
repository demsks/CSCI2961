### 1. 
the fundementals behind Open Source Technology single handedly provide an enviroment for those trying to benefit the world 
through Computer Code to thrive in. From the earliest days of Computers, engineers and programers alike have collaborated 
to collectively make not only our technolgy better, but also the world. This collective would simply not work if not for the 
ideas behind open source technology. The purpose of Open Source technology is simple in that it allows people from around the 
globe to come together and work to improve some code base. With the ability to share knowledge through Computer Programs, 
entire communities benefit.

I beleive the most important aspects of providing a good answer to a question is to provide not only a clear and concise
answer, but also one that the asker will understand. Additionally, although I don't like to admit it, I have given advice
or answered questions for which I have provided the wrong answers in the past. Although this seeems like a given, make sure
you know the topic and verify the information you are giving is correct before you give it!

What I got more than anything from reading chapter 3 was disgust. It sadens me to see something so vile happen to a student 
who's end goal was to do nothing more than learn while helping his fellow students. The RIAA bullied him into giving them what 
amounts to pennies compared to their profits, using the "justice" system as their own personal weapon. Was this fair? 
Not in the least bit, but I'm glad to see that it didn't prevent Jesse from continuing his work and becomming an activist.

## g. Reflection

I have never worked on an Open Source project, so the path for finding a project to work on is certainly a new one for me. However, I 
am finding a plethora of information online which essentially outlines not only how to get involved, but how to be useful. There is a 
Reddit thread dedicated to Newer Programmers getting involved in Open Source that I found which I will be going through thuroughly in 
addition to the links that Professor Krishnamoorthy has provided.
